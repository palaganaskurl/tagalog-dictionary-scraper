## How To Run
Create virtualenv or whatever your environment is

python src/tagalog_dictionary_scraper.py
```

## Words
Words scraped are inside the words folder.

## Issues
Some punctuation marks are not removed in the definition.

I manually checked some of the results but not all because there are thousands of result.

No automated testing to check if the scraped words and information are correct.

And many more...
